The Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME) is a curious component of Galactic radiation best explained as a product of spinning dust grains in the interstellar medium (ISM). Understanding this emmission is a crucial step towards unveiling the origins of the Universe, as the AME is a key foreground component impeding Cosmic Microwave Background observations. Here we analyze the presence of AME in our Galaxy in comparison to characteristics of HI gas; specifically, we look for relations between variations in AME spectra and the proportion of Cold Neutral Medium (CNM), a component of HI clouds.
