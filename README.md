# In Search of a link between Anomolous Microwave Emission and Cold Neutral Medium

Understanding Anomolous Microwave Emission (AME), a component of Galactic radiation widely attributed to ultra-small spinning dust, helps to inform us of the makeup of the ISM, as it is strongly dependent on several parameters of the local medium. Beyond that, the AME is a key foreground component in Cosmic Microwave Background observations, and better understanding its properties will help us with more precise component separation and CMB analyses at low GHz frequencies. Here we look for correlations between AME spectra and the mass fraction of the Cold Neutral Medium from total HI column density (fCNM). Using data from a neural network prediction of fCNM along with spinning dust emission maps from Planck 2015, in a region limited to Galactic latitudes |b| > 30°, we find a correlation between fCNM and AME — however, this correlation appears to be equally or less significant than that between fCNM and thermal dust emission, leading to the conclusion that the dust responsible for AME has no special preference for the CNM.
