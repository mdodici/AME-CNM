# AME-CNM

The Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME) is a curious component of Galactic radiation widely thought to originate from spinning, ultra-small dust grains in the interstellar medium. Understanding this emmission helps to inform us of the makeup of the ISM, as it is strongly dependent on several parameters of the local medium. Beyond that, the AME is a key foreground component in Cosmic Microwave Background observations, and better understanding its properties will help us with component separation and CMB analyses at low ~GHz frequencies. Here we analyze the AME in comparison to characteristics of HI in our Galaxy; specifically, we look for relations between AME spectra and the proportion of Cold Neutral Medium column density to total HI column density (fCNM). Using data from a neural network prediction of fCNM in a region limited to Galactic latitudes |b| > 30â—¦, along with spinning dust emission maps from Planck 2015, we perform several analyses in an effort to find correlations between fCNM and AME.
